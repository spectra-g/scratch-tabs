Feature: NDJSON content processing

  Background:
    Given I am on the homepage

  Scenario: Clean and extract valid JSON from mixed NDJSON content
    When I set clipboard content to:
      """
      2025-08-01T10 : 15:30.123Z {"event":"user_login","user_id":123,"ip":"192.168.1.10"}
      2025-1.004Z sdc {"event":"view_page","user_id":123,"page":"/dashboard"}
      2025-08-01T10 : 15:35.876Z sdvsdvsdv{"event":"click_button","user_id":123,"button_id":"submit-form"}
      sdvsdv2025-08-01T10 : 15:42.110Z {"event":"api_call","user_id":123,"endpoint":"/api/data","status":200}
      xcvdsvsdvsdvs {"event":"logout","user_id":123}
      """
    And I click the icon for "New tab with contents from clipboard"
    Then the "Welcome" tab should exist and not be active
    And the "Scratch 1" tab should be active
    And each line should be valid JSON
    And the active editor content should contain "user_login"
    And the active editor content should contain "view_page"
    And the active editor content should contain "click_button"
    And the active editor content should contain "api_call"
    And the active editor content should contain "logout"
    And the status bar language should be "JSON Log"
